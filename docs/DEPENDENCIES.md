# Dependency Policy

## Internal Dependencies

Required:

- None.

Optional:

- None.

All internal dependencies are consumed through VXrepo package recipes. This repository does not rely on a monorepo, a sibling checkout, Git submodules, copied public headers, or private upstream implementation files.

## Version Rules

- During `0.x`, pin one compatible minor range, for example `>=0.1.0 <0.2.0`.
- Stable releases never depend on a moving branch.
- Applications should commit their resolved dependency lock; libraries test the documented minimum and newest compatible versions.
- An upstream version increase requires public API review, full tests, and changelog notes.

## Third-Party Dependencies

A mandatory third-party dependency requires answers to these questions:

1. Why are the standard library and current internal interfaces insufficient?
2. Does the dependency enter a hot path or public ABI?
3. Is the license compatible with the chosen project license?
4. Is it maintained across Tier-1 platforms?
5. Can it be replaced behind a narrow provider or adapter?
6. Who owns security update monitoring?

Development-only test and benchmark tools must not leak into installed headers or link interfaces.

## Upstream Failure Process

1. Refresh VXrepo metadata and inspect the resolved package version.
2. Reproduce against the newest version allowed by the current range.
3. Reproduce against the newest upstream development state in an isolated workspace when necessary.
4. Reduce the failure to a minimal public-API example.
5. Open an upstream issue/request with compatibility and test requirements.
6. Do not vendor or privately patch upstream source in this repository.

The local Chinese Agent guide contains the required handoff template.
